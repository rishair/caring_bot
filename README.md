# Caring Challenge Bot

## Problem
After Actively Caring sessions we see students filled with energy to create a better environment for
them and their peers.

However it's difficult to find a concrete and reliable outlet for this new found energy. Some
students attempt to organize large projects with their new found momentum while others see it fade.
We'd like to give every student the ability to easily sustain this drive with the hope of it
becoming a habit.

## Whats the idea?
We'd like to give students an easy way to maintain the momentum after a session concludes. The idea
is to get students in the habit of acting selflessly on a daily basis by giving concrete
suggestions of "actively caring".

It's posed as a "challenge" that includes both social and individual game mechanics to keep students
engaged.

This project is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org) messaging bot that serves as a product we can
dogfood and iterate on. It mimics the types of notifications and interactions we imagine students
would be engaged with and allows participants to experiment with rules along the way.

## What does it do?
There are many moving parts and experiments that will happen over the coming weeks but at it's core
the bot is repsonsible for:

- Organizing and managing teams
- Maintaining a list of "actively caring" deeds (e.g. "give a compliment to a friend")
- Provide a small subset of those listings to participants every day
- Allow participants to record which deeds were completed
- Provide social and individual game mechanics around completing deeds (congratulatory messages,
  streaks, encouragement, etc.)
